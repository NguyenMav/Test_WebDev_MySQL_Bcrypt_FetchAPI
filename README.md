Hi!

So for this to work, you must first do this:

1. Download all the files in your chosen directory.

2. Open up VSCode or whatever you like and locate this directory through the terminal.

3. Run 'npm init' and add whatever details you require.

4. Install all necessary modules for this to work by running 'npm install express mysql2 bcrypt'.

5. Make sure you have MySQL server downloaded and change the database connection password to whatever you set.

6. Then run 'node createDB.js' to make a database and table in MySQL server.

7. That's it! I hope you know what else to do from here. Just run 'node index.js' once everything has been adjusted for you.
